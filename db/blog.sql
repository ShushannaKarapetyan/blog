Slightly bigger plants like peace lilies can take up some floor space, but they won&rsquo;t overwhelm any corner of the room with lush leaves or big roots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best part about most small potted plants is that they can fit almost anywhere in your home. You can even get creative! Think about adding some cute plants in unexpected places like near your bathroom window, in a hanging planter or even on your wall with a space-saving&nbsp;vertical wall garden!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>10 Small Indoor Plants to Spruce Up Your Space</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To help you get started, we rounded up our favorite small indoor plants and included a few tips for&nbsp;styling them in a small space.

These are great if you&rsquo;re looking for a small plant and don&rsquo;t want to deal with pots or soil. If you choose to house your air plant in a terrarium, make sure it has an opening so it gets plenty of circulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>🌞 Needs: Full Sun;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>💧 Needs: Mist 2-3 times a week;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>⭐ Best For: Shelf Decor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2.

These plants are easy to propagate, so the easiest way to acquire your own is to find a friend or online exchange willing to help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>🌞 Needs: Partial Shade;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>💧&nbsp;Needs: Well-Drained;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>⭐&nbsp;Best For: Shelf Decor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>8.

(17, 'Sunflower', 'Sunflower Facts That Are So Sweet', 'sunflower', '<p>Picture a common sunflower in your mind &mdash; what do you see?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people may describe sunflowers as tall, yellow and bright, but this classic&nbsp;sunflower&nbsp;imagery simply doesn&rsquo;t do the plant justice. Sunflowers are dynamic because they grow in various shapes, sizes and colors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use the following 16 sunflower facts to inspire the way you view sunflowers. Learn about the sunflower plant itself and some health benefits below. Let&rsquo;s start with the basics: colors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Not All Sunflowers Are Yellow</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"sunflower facts\" src=\"https://proflowers.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-sunflower-facts.png\" style=\"height:291px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A universal fact most people know is sunflowers are yellow. However, a sunflower&rsquo;s pigment doesn&rsquo;t stop there. Sunflowers can even be red and purple!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Yellow Sunflowers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Some examples of yellow sunflowers include American Giant, Zohar and Elegance. These sunflower types are vibrant and sure to make you smile. The American Giant sunflower can grow up to 14 feet tall, so &ldquo;giant&rdquo; may be an understatement. This species is one of the tallest sunflowers and their faces can reach 12 inches wide.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Red Sunflowers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As the nursery rhyme taught us, roses are red. In addition to roses, many types of flowers are red, including some sunflowers.&nbsp;Red sunflowers&nbsp;come in different varieties. Some of them have similar daisy-like heads which are often born of the common yellow sunflowers. Additionally, red sunflowers are an excellent way to add a pop of color in a bouquet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Purple Sunflowers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A common &ldquo;purple sunflower&rdquo; is the Chianti Hybrid. A Chianti Hybrid&rsquo;s petals have deep, dark reds which some classify as purple. This sunflower plant can grow to five feet and has no pollen, making it good for cutting. These sunflowers can help balance color in&nbsp;mixed bouquets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Vincent Van Gogh Wasn&rsquo;t the Only Sunflower Painter</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;ve taken an art class or not, odds are you&rsquo;re familiar with name Vincent van Gogh. Van Gogh is remembered for his sunflower paintings and changing the way people viewed a flower&rsquo;s beauty. Some artists who were influenced by him include Diego Rivera, Alfred Gockel and Paul Gauguin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Diego Rivera</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Diego Rivera incorporated sunflowers in a handful of his paintings. One example is &ldquo;Muchacha Con Girasoles.&rdquo; This painting portrays a girl organizing a vase with sunflowers. Both Van Gogh and Diego Rivera commonly portrayed peasant life and flower imagery in their pieces.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Alfred Gockel</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Alfred Gockel&rsquo;s style includes the use of primary colors with deep accents. One of Gockel&rsquo;s paintings is titled &ldquo;Giant Sunflower.&rdquo; By using primary colors, Gockel made his sunflower come alive. Many people find this work unique.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paul Gauguin</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul Gaugin introduced inception with his art &ldquo;Vincent van Gogh Painting Sunflowers.&rdquo; The piece itself is fictional, since Gaugin wasn&rsquo;t there when van Gogh was painting his famous sunflower painting. Gaugin enjoyed working from his imagination to inspire this painting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Sunflowers Are Connected to Apollo</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Sunflowers have numerous&nbsp;meanings and symbols. Some date back to Greek mythology with the story of Clytie and Apollo, god of the sun. Apollo, already in love with Clytie, one day was struck by the beauty of a king&rsquo;s princess named Leucothoe. Lecucothe&rsquo;s father did not allow her to see Apollo, but this didn&rsquo;t stop Apollo from seeing her.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One night Clytie discovered Apollo and Leucothoe together and told Lecuothe&rsquo;s father out of jealousy. As a result, Leucothoe was buried alive at her father&rsquo;s order. Apollo, out of grief, turned Clytie into a sunflower to avoid having to look at her again. Talk about drama!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Sunflowers Can Range in Height</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"ÐÐ¾ÑÐ¾Ð¶ÐµÐµ Ð¸Ð·Ð¾Ð±ÑÐ°Ð¶ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ðµ\" src=\"http://www.takii.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Helianthus-F1-Sunny-Smile-x-3-800x533.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sunflowers are regularly classified into two categories: tall and dwarf. Despite popular belief that sunflower plants are giants, some don&rsquo;t get taller than two feet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tall Sunflowers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Tall sunflowers are generally yellow and durable. Most of these sunflowers reach 12 to 16 feet tall and even higher in special circumstances. Types of tall sunflowers include Skyscraper, Sunforest Mix and Russian Mammoth. Most of these sunflowers are enjoyed by birds for their height and abundance of seeds. This makes tall sunflowers attractive for people who enjoy bird watching.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Dwarf Sunflowers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dwarf sunflowers commonly grow in clusters and immerse themselves in small gardens and pots. These sunflowers are classified as dwarfs because they tend to not grow taller than 3 feet. Dwarf sunflower types include Little Becka, Suntastic Yellow and Pacino.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A commonality between dwarf and tall sunflowers is they both grow best in full sunlight.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. Young Sunflowers Track the Sun</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A fun sunflower fact is young sunflowers track the sun, also referred to as heliotropism. In a study by&nbsp;ScienceMag, scientists reveal sunflowers have circadian rhythms, which promote this behavior. A young sunflower&rsquo;s face follows the sun from sunrise to sunset every day and repeats the cycle until maturity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6. Mature Sunflowers Face East</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As sunflowers reach maturity, their internal clocks start slowing down until they finish the heliotropism behavior completely. Don&rsquo;t worry, this process does not harm sunflowers. A&nbsp;ScienceMag study&nbsp;reveals mature sunflowers face East for a couple different reasons:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Sunflowers can attract up to five times more pollinators because they warm up faster than westward facing plants.</li>\r\n	<li>Sunflowers are more productively warmed when Eastward facing.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>7. Sunflower Oil Has an Anti-Inflammatory Effect&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"ÐÐ¾ÑÐ¾Ð¶ÐµÐµ Ð¸Ð·Ð¾Ð±ÑÐ°Ð¶ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ðµ\" src=\"https://bodyworkbistro.com/bodyworkbistro/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/sunflower.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sunflower plant offers additional benefits besides beauty. Sunflower oil is suggested to possess anti-inflammatory properties. It contains linoleic acid which can convert to arachidonic acid. Both are fatty acids and can help reduce water loss and repair the skin barrier.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>8. There Are Two Types of Sunflower Seed Production</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Sunflower facts can be sporty too! They&rsquo;re a popular snack among baseball fans. Next time you take your family out to a ball game, thank sunflowers for your salty, crunchy snack. There are two common types of sunflower seed: oilseed and non-oilseed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Oilseed</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Oilseed sunflower production is the most commonly farmed sunflower. These seeds hulls&rsquo; are encased by solid black shells. Black oilseeds are a common type of bird feed because they have thin shells and a high fat content. These are typically produced for oil extraction purposes; therefore, it is unlikely you&rsquo;ll find black oilseeds packaged for human consumption.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Non-oilseed</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Non-oilseed is the production of sunflower seeds for human consumption. These seeds are protected by striped hulls. The non-oilseeds grow on the flower head part of the sunflower plant.&nbsp;Healthline&nbsp;notes sunflower seeds are high in Vitamin E and selenium which help prevent chronic disease.&nbsp;</p>', 0, 'jpeg_1566225794.jpg', '2019-08-18 13:51:08', '2019-08-19 10:43:14'),
(18, 'Red Wine', 'Red Wine Information & Basics', 'red-wine', '<p>With hundreds of varieties of red wine grapes, there is as much red wine information to learn about as there are red grapes planted in all corners of the globe. That being said, you&rsquo;ll likely encounter only a handful of these grapes most often. Here, we cover the flavor profiles and regions of the most common red wine grapes. You can certainly choose to discover more beyond this short list, but for a quick and easy red wine 101, the following will fit the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Types of Red Wine Grapes</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"ÐÐ°ÑÑÐ¸Ð½ÐºÐ¸ Ð¿Ð¾ Ð·Ð°Ð¿ÑÐ¾ÑÑ red wine dom  wallpaper\" src=\"http://kazzit.com/custom/domain_1/image_files/Blog_Photos/sitemgr_wineandchocolate2.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Cabernet Franc</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Flavors: Violets, blueberry, earth, black olive, coffee</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, Cabernet Franc is part of the essential blending triad that makes up the majority of the Bordeaux blend (and Meritage) red wines produced in the United States. On its own, Cabernet Franc is a more tannic, earthy cousin to Cabernet Sauvignon. In warmer sites outside of Europe, its most distinctive attributes are its pure notes of violets and blueberry, and its ripe tannins often carry the scent of fresh roasted coffee. It is made (though rarely labeled) as a varietal in Chinon, Bourgueil, and Saumur-Champigny, where it is hard and tannic and can evoke an austere minerality. In Pomerol and Saint-&Eacute;milion it is featured in blends with Merlot, adding a spicy, pungent, sometimes minty note.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Cabernet Sauvignon</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Flavors: Bell pepper, green olive, herb, cassis, black cherry</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary component of great Bordeaux and the defining grape of the Napa Valley, Cabernet Sauvignon is grown all over the world, but rarely achieves greatness. It ripens late and can be quite weedy and even vegetal in cooler climate regions such as Chile. In Bordeaux and Tuscany it is almost always blended to soften its intensely astringent tannins. The Napa style is dense, purple-black, jammy and tasting of currants and black cherries. Thick and ripe, layered with expensive new oak scents and flavors, it has almost single-handedly created the phenomenon of the cult wineries. In Washington, the best Cabernet straddles the border between the ripeness of California versions and the nuanced herb, leaf, and olive flavors of great Bordeaux.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Gamay</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Flavors: Strawberry, raspberry, cherry</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The grape of Beaujolais, Gamay is often made to be drunk quite young, and shows bright, tangy, fruit-driven flavors of strawberry, raspberry, and sweet cherries. When made by the method known as carbonic maceration, young Gamay has a slight effervescence and a distinct smell of bananas. Beaujolais Nouveau, released each year shortly after harvest, is the most famous example.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Grenache/Garnacha</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Flavors: Spice, cherry</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Old vine Grenache makes some of the greatest red wines of both Spain and Australia, and is an important component of Ch&acirc;teauneuf du Pape, Gigondas, and C&ocirc;tes du Rh&ocirc;ne in France. An early-ripening grape, it tends toward high alcohol and low acidity. At its best it creates very fruity, spicy, bold-flavored wines somewhat reminiscent of a softer, less-intense version of Syrah.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Malbec</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Flavors: Sour cherry, spice</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the blending grapes of Bordeaux, Malbec has risen to prominence in Argentina, where it makes spicy, tart red wines that take well to aging in new oak barrels. Elsewhere it remains a minor player, though a few varietally labeled Malbecs are made in California and Washington.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Merlot</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Flavors: Watermelon, strawberry, cherry, plum</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Merlot is the Chardonnay of reds, easy to pronounce, easy to like, agreeable, and versatile, but mostly lacking any substantive character of its own. The great exception is Chateau P&eacute;trus, where it comprises 95 percent of the blend. Varietal&nbsp;<a href=\"http://buyingguide.www.winemag.com/varietals/merlot?afid=INTEXT.VARIETIES\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Merlot</a>&nbsp;rose to popularity in the 1990s but too many insipid, watery, over-priced Merlots have taken the bloom off the rose. Outside of Bordeaux, it is at its very best in Washington state, where it ripens beautifully and creates plump, powerful wines that can age for a decade or more.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Mourv&egrave;dre/Mataro</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Flavors: Spice, cherry</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This Mediterranean red grape is especially popular in France and Spain, making medium-bodied, lightly spicy wines with pretty, cherry-flavored fruit. The best sites also add a distinctive, gravelly minerality to the fruit. Some old vine plantings of Mourv&egrave;dre remain in California and also in Australia, where it is generally featured in a blend with Shiraz and Grenache.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Nebbiolo</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Flavors: Plum, pie cherry, tar</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The principal grape of Barolo, Barbaresco, and Gattinara (all made in the Piedmont region of Italy), Nebbiolo unquestionably belongs with the great red wines of the world, but has proven almost impossible to grow anywhere else. California versions, despite decades of effort, remain light, thin and generic.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Pinot Noir</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Flavors: Tomato leaf, beet root, pale cherry, blackberry, cola, plum</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Pinot Noir is the grape that winemakers love to hate; it is the prettiest, sexiest, most demanding, and least predictable of all. The template for great Pinot Noir is Burgundy, but even there the grape is flighty, fragile, and prone to obstinately weedy flavors. It is a principal component of many Champagnes and other sparkling wines, but can also be ripened to produce wines of surprising density and even jammyness in California, New Zealand, and warm sites in Oregon. Pinot Noir is best expressed as a pure varietal, and is often featured as a single-vineyard wine in Oregon and California, emulating the hundreds of tiny appellations of Burgundy. When at its best, Pinot has an ethereal delicacy yet can age for decades; it is most memorably described as &ldquo;the iron fist in the velvet glove.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Sangiovese</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Flavors: Pie cherry, anise, tobacco leaf</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The principal grape of Tuscany, where it is the primary component of Chianti and Brunello di Montalcino. Sangiovese is relatively light in color and quite firmly acidic. In Italy it shows distinctive flavors of pie cherry, anise, and tobacco; elsewhere it can be rather plain and undistinguished, though some promising bottles have come from Washington&rsquo;s Walla Walla Valley. Many of Italy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Super Tuscan&rdquo;&nbsp; red blends marry Sangiovese to Cabernet Sauvignon, a combination that both strengthens the Sangiovese and smooths out the Cabernet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Syrah/Shiraz</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"ÐÐ¾ÑÐ¾Ð¶ÐµÐµ Ð¸Ð·Ð¾Ð±ÑÐ°Ð¶ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ðµ\" src=\"https://s1.1zoom.me/b6160/607/Wine_Black_background_Bottle_Stemware_512316_2560x1440.jpg\" style=\"height:394px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Flavors: Blackberry, boysenberry, plum, pepper, clove</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Plantings of&nbsp;Syrah&nbsp;have exploded in California and Washington, where sappy, spicy, peppery, luscious versions are being made. Known as Shiraz in Australia, it is unarguably that country&rsquo;s claim to enological fame. Australian Shiraz is made in every conceivable style, from light and fruity to dense and tarry; it is made as a deep red, tannic sparkling wine, and also as a fortified &ldquo;Port&rdquo;. In the northern Rh&ocirc;ne, the most extraordinary expressions of the grape are produced, especially in Hermitage and C&ocirc;te R&ocirc;tie, where its peppery, dense, spicy fruit is layered into unbelievably complex wines streaked with mineral, smoked meat, tar, wild herb, and leather.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Zinfandel</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Flavors: Raspberry, blackberry, black cherry, raisin, prune</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For decades Zinfandel was California&rsquo;s grape, though now it is grown all over the west coast of the United States, in Australia, Italy, and elsewhere, and its ancestry has been traced to Croatia. But California Zinfandel remains the model for all others, and it grows well and vinifies distinctively all over the state. Mendocino makes somewhat rustic versions with hints of Asian spices; Dry Creek Zinfandels are racy and laden with raspberry. In Amador and Gold Rush country it is hot, thick, and jammy, while in Napa it is plush with ripe, sweet black cherry flavors. California Zinfandels now commonly reach 15 or 16 percent alcohol levels; sometimes even higher for late harvest versions. Zinfandel &ldquo;Ports&rdquo; are also made.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Red Wine &amp; Food Pairings</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Red wine&rsquo;s diverse styles and structure make it the ideal choice for the dinner table. Red wine has a firmer structure than typical white and ros&eacute; wines supporting it when coming up against strong flavors. Steak and Cabernet is the tried and true pairing, fuller-bodied red wines in general pair well with denser, heavier foods, while lighter bodied reds with high acidity pair well with lighter fare, like roasted chicken and vegetable dishes. Matching the weight of the wine with the richness of the food leads to successful and harmonious pairings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old adage, &ldquo;what grows together, goes together&rdquo; holds true as well. For example, traditional tomato sauce Italian dishes pair well with the high-acid red wines of Chianti. In general, a region&rsquo;s wine will pair well with the food and lifestyle of the area.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Red Wine&rsquo;s Ageability</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"ÐÐ°ÑÑÐ¸Ð½ÐºÐ¸ Ð¿Ð¾ Ð·Ð°Ð¿ÑÐ¾ÑÑ red wine wallpaper\" src=\"http://www.af-usa.org/seeimg/big/66/660969_wine-wallpaper-for-mobile.jpg\" style=\"height:438px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Red wine is heralded for its ageability, but in order for a wine to age to its full potential, it must be stored properly. Factors that affect the aging process are temperature, light and humidity. Red wines should be stored at about 55&deg; Fahrenheit, 10&deg; F below the ideal serving temperature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wines stored too warm will accelerate the aging process, while wines stored in hot temperatures, above 75&deg; Fahrenheit can be &ldquo;cooked,&rdquo; causing the fruit flavors characteristics to turn mushy and baked. A red wine stored too cold can also damage the wine, but is generally not as dangerous as overheating the wine. Low temperatures slow the aging process, but if your wine doesn&rsquo;t freeze, there likely won&rsquo;t be any extensive damage. Colder temperatures, like a 40&deg; Fahrenheit refrigerator, are fine for short-term storage. Wines that freeze pose their own problems. As the liquid freezes it expands and can push the cork out, compromising the wine, or worse, cracking the bottle. While small changes in temperature are safe, it&rsquo;s important to keep your wines at the most consistent temperature possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Red wines are bottled in green or brown tinted bottles to protect them from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Light-bodied wines are at a greater risk of being spoiled by light than full-bodied wines, but it&rsquo;s best to avoid any long-term exposure to light, both natural and artificial. UV rays can break down compounds in the wine causing it too age more rapidly, and light carries damaging heat as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A delicate balance of humidity is also vital to red wine storage. Wines kept in a dry environment put the cork at risk, if the cork dries out it can shrink and allow oxygen to seep into the bottle or wine to leak out.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Red Wine Stemware</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many different wine glasses on the market from traditional to quirky. While a fun shaped or designed glass can be great for less formal occasions, having the proper glass will enhance your wine-drinking experience. There are two main shapes for red wine glasses: the tall, tapered Bordeaux glass and the wide bowl Burgundy glass. The tall, narrow Bordeaux glass has a tapered opening that concentrates the aromas of the wine. Its height creates distance between the wine and your nose, allowing sharp, burning ethanol aromas to dissipate. The Bordeaux glass should be used for fuller bodied, higher alcohol wines with spicier notes and is traditionally used with the Cabernet and Merlot based wines of Bordeaux. The wide bowled Burgundy glass is best implemented when drinking lighter bodied reds with more delicate aromas. The shape of the bowl helps trap and concentrate the aromas. Regardless of shape, wine glasses should be stemmed to prevent heat from hands being transferred to the wine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are numerous ways to cook with red wine. Whether you use it to glaze, braise or even boil pasta, choosing the right wine can be difficult. Forget the cooking wine. Grocery store cooking wine often has other additives like salt and should be avoided. Luckily most recipes offer suggestions for the style of wine to be implemented, even if it is as vague as &ldquo;dry wine&rdquo;. If a recipe calls for 1 cup of wine, consider purchasing a half bottle, which contains a little over one and a half cups of wine. Be sure to consider the dish when selecting the wine. If you are only deglazing the pan, leftover wine from the past few days will work fine. However, if wine is a key flavor component to the dish, the wine you select will have a greater impact. Dry wines should be used for savory dishes while sweet wines are better for desserts. When in doubt, select a dry red wine with low to moderate tannins to complement most dishes. Always cook with wine you wouldn&rsquo;t mind drinking as the quality of the wine will affect the flavors of your dish.</p>', 0, 'jpeg_1566226178.jpg', '2019-08-18 14:14:32', '2019-08-19 10:49:38'),
(19, 'Caffee Culture', 'Caffee Culture: A Guide to Italian Caffee', 'coffee', '<p>A while back I was sat in a&nbsp;<em>bar</em>&nbsp;at 9am destroying a chocolate croissant (In case you&rsquo;re worried about why I was in a bar at that time of the morning don&rsquo;t worry that&rsquo;s the Italian word for caf&eacute;). &nbsp;While contemplating my addiction to sweet, Italian pastries I became aware of an American tourist who had come in and was standing at the bar. In her best guide book Italian she requested &ldquo;un latte&rdquo; and smiled smugly at how well she was doing with this whole language barrier thing. &nbsp;The smile turned to dismay a few moments later when in front of her was placed a big glass of milk. &nbsp;You see despite the world taking on Italianisms we all seem to get it wrong. To avoid such disappointment here is my guide to Italian coffee and the caff&egrave; culture that comes with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where my American friend (and yes to me this perfect stranger was a friend; anyone who tries so gallantly in Italy and yet fails is always a friend of mine! Been there, done that, got the whole T-Shirt factory) had gone wrong was by assuming that Starbucks had been based around real Italian coffee. Alas, it&rsquo;s nowhere near, as any Italian or expat will tell you after trying a commercial, franchised &ldquo;coffee&rdquo; which is so lauded outside of Italy but in fact just tastes like dirty water. &nbsp;&nbsp;Like in any culture, there is a certain etiquette that Italian coffee demands and the sooner you get to grips with this the more caffeine-fueled and happier your life will become. &nbsp;Incidentally, I knew the American lady was a tourist before she even opened her mouth as she looked around the tables for a coffee menu. &nbsp;In the majority of coffee shops, particularly in the South, this does not exist. Caff&egrave; culture is something that is so ingrained it doesn&rsquo;t need an explanation. &nbsp;Besides, if you want to veer from the classics you will be expected to specifically dictate precisely how you want your coffee as this obviously proves you&rsquo;re a particular person!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>The Rules of Italian Coffee Consumption</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"ÐÐ°ÑÑÐ¸Ð½ÐºÐ¸ Ð¿Ð¾ Ð·Ð°Ð¿ÑÐ¾ÑÑ italian coffee wallpaper\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Cappuccino_Chiang_Mai.JPG\" style=\"height:700px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your go to coffee &nbsp;in any situation is an espresso, with an S not an X by the way. Not that it&rsquo;s ever called that of course, in fact if you order an espresso you might even get an eyebrow raise, because it is universally understood as a &ldquo;caff&egrave;.&rdquo; It needs no explanation as it is simply what a coffee should be, according to Italian tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This short, strong Italian coffee is normally drunk with one sugar as standard and is perfect for re-fuelling. &nbsp;This is designed to be drunk on your feet, standing at the bar (especially in tourist hotspots so you don&rsquo;t get ripped off with tourist charges) and will give a kick to your day, whether that be waking you up or finishing off a meal. &nbsp;It is deliberately small and powerful, don&rsquo;t scorn at the tiny cup or glass it&rsquo;s presented in and be tempted to order a double. You just don&rsquo;t do that. Do however feel free to return even within the hour for another. Little and often is the way to go but be warned though they be small they are fierce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a caff&egrave; is simply too strong for you, an acceptable substitute is a caff&egrave; macchiato, literally a marked coffee, because a dash of foamy milk will be poured in the top of it and this takes the edge of it slightly. &nbsp;As an English tea-lover I have grown up on milk and so for me I always go with a macchiato because it&rsquo;s just that little bit creamier. &nbsp;It looks like a teeny tiny cappuccino but like it&rsquo;s bigger, more traditional brother can be consumed throughout the day as much as your heart can take. This cannot be said for the cappuccino which is one of the most misunderstood coffees in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&rsquo;ve said&nbsp;before, when it comes to the Cappuccino, the rest of the world just simply doesn&rsquo;t understand it. In England I remember regularly ordering one after dinner as a way to wind up the meal. &nbsp;When I told my husband this he looked aghast. &ldquo;But why would you want milk after dinner???&rdquo; And that I think is the big difference, and why tea (in the English, Builder&rsquo;s sense) will never catch on in Italy. &nbsp;The cappuccino is viewed as a breakfast item as it is a way to get your daily milk fix, something which in Italy is definitely a morning thing. &nbsp;This is why you&rsquo;re not supposed to order one after 11am because it would be like ordering cornflakes after dinner. While baristas may turn their nose up slightly, you can of course order whatever you like as long as you are paying for it. &nbsp;To truly integrate however, order one at breakfast with a big, flaky cornetto and enjoy it in the way it&rsquo;s intended. Again, however, do not be disappointed by the size. To the average American/English used to the XXXL servings from high street International franchises, the original Italian cappuccino might seem a little on the small side. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t worry, this is how it&rsquo;s intended to be. So, when in Rome&hellip;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other Italian coffee variations which are particularly interesting are&nbsp;<em>caff&egrave; corretto</em>&nbsp;(a corrected coffee). What could possibly correct a coffee I hear you ask? Alcohol of course! This is the hair-of-the-dog coffee reserved for the strong and mighty. Either consumed at the start of the night, at the end of a hearty meal or the morning after, this is rocket fuel at its finest, a short, strong coffee shot with a shot of alcohol added for good measure. &nbsp;Usually this is grappa but it can also be brandy or sambuca, depending on what tipple makes you happy. &nbsp;If you love a bit of chocolate then why not order a&nbsp;<em>caff&egrave; marrochino,&nbsp;</em>a coffee where the cup is dusted with cocoa powder (or smeared in nutella as I&rsquo;ve seen in some bars) cream is added and then topped off with yet more cocoa powder.

But why?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the tangibility of having this collectible format and a way to play music that isn&rsquo;t just a stream or download,&rdquo; says techno&nbsp;DJ Phin, who has just released her first EP on cassette as label boss of&nbsp;Theory of Yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I find them much more attractive than CDs. Tapes have a lifespan, and unlike digital music, there is decay and death. It&rsquo;s like a living thing and that appeals to me.&rdquo; Phin left the bulk of her own 100-strong cassette collection in Turkey, carefully stored at her parents&rsquo; home, but bought &ldquo;20 or 25 really special ones&rdquo; when she moved to London. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m from that generation,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nostalgia thing &ndash; I like the hiss.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"ÐÐ°ÑÑÐ¸Ð½ÐºÐ¸ Ð¿Ð¾ Ð·Ð°Ð¿ÑÐ¾ÑÑ retro cassette wallpaper\" src=\"https://wallpaperplay.com/walls/full/d/7/9/271218.jpg\" style=\"height:394px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That familiar thunk, click and whir of a cassette being played in a stereo makes up the opening note of&nbsp;Calvin Harris&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dua Lipa&rsquo;s global floorfiller&nbsp;One Kiss; the track was the UK&rsquo;s biggest single of 2018 and spent eight weeks at No 1.

Hi-fi store Richer Sounds is selling two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the independent record store Rough Trade, marketing manager Emily Waller can&rsquo;t say whether customers are actually playing the cassettes they buy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still a nice put-me-in-your-pocket keepsake or collectible for a fan. Old stuff is hip, right? We&rsquo;ve seen through vinyl sales the increase in demand for these &lsquo;retro&rsquo; formats, particularly among young people.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cassette culture is thriving in the electronic music, DIY and avant-garde scenes where labels such as Manchester-based&nbsp;Sacred Tapes&nbsp;and Ireland&rsquo;s&nbsp;Fort Label Fruit&nbsp;are pushing tapes to fans via online music platform Bandcamp. The cheap cost and fast turnaround of manufacturing cassettes is a key part of the appeal for those committed to the cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Vinyl has got so expensive to manufacture these days, especially if it&rsquo;s only a seven-inch you&rsquo;re putting out. You&rsquo;ll only lose money on a seven-inch release,&rdquo; says Tallulah Webb, who runs cassette-only label&nbsp;Sad Club Records. &ldquo;Cassettes are an exciting way to put music out, in the same way that seven-inch singles were exciting for punk. They have always been a crucial part of the DIY scene.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Retromania is nothing new. The fondness for recycling pop culture&rsquo;s past has become a defining marker of millennial culture: the industry for &ldquo;nostalgia marketing&rdquo; has boomed for brands selling to the under-35s. And so Instagram is awash with #vintage #cassette posts, and over on Etsy, a&nbsp;replica plastic Sony Walkman&nbsp;(one that can&rsquo;t actually play any music) is being sold for &pound;79.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But not everyone is keen. Peter Robinson, founder and editor of&nbsp;Popjustice, believes the trend for tapes is a gimmick too far. &ldquo;Cassettes are the worst-ever music format, and I say that as someone who owns a Keane single on a USB stick,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I can understand the romance and the tactile appeal of the vinyl revival, but I&rsquo;m actually quite amused by the audacity of anyone attempting to drum up some sense of nostalgia for a format that was barely tolerated in its supposed heyday. It&rsquo;s like someone looked at the vinyl revival and said: what this needs is lower sound quality and even less convenience.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Streaming now accounts for nearly two-thirds of music consumption in the UK and while demand for vinyl is up by 2,000% since the format&rsquo;s low point in 2007, the market share for cassettes is tiny. Robinson is cynical about cassette sales whirring back to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think labels know full well that almost every cassette they sell is going straight on a shelf as some sort of dreadful plastic ornament,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s much different to the recent trend for pop stars adding pairs of socks to their merchandise lines, the crucial difference being that, for better or worse, socks don&rsquo;t count towards the album chart.&rdquo;</p>', 0, 'jpeg_1566243412.jpg', '2019-08-18 14:52:41', '2019-08-19 15:36:52'),

However, compared to humanity&rsquo;s long history with money, cryptocurrency is in its infancy. While many people are already very familiar with Bitcoin, more people still have some learning to do. This has lead to some pretty interesting stories about people interacting with cryptocurrency. To feel better about your personal Bitcoin story, take a look at these stories from around the web.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Getting into Bitcoin Early</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"ÐÐ¾ÑÐ¾Ð¶ÐµÐµ Ð¸Ð·Ð¾Ð±ÑÐ°Ð¶ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ðµ\" src=\"https://coinrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/what-is-blockchain-technology.jpg\" style=\"height:394px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three months ago, u/thecommontheme&nbsp;posted&nbsp;his Bitcoin story on the discussion site Reddit. The meandering post tells the story of a 19-year-old who found out about&nbsp;Bitcoin&nbsp;by accident in 2011, when most people had not yet heard of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The poster was so inspired by the technology that they saved up $3,000 to invest in the cryptocurrency when BTC was still worth around $13. Towards the end of the story a Bitcoin had risen to around $600 and the poster was able to use much of their Bitcoin fortune to pay for a friend&rsquo;s surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post was written mainly to inspire the r/Bitcoin Reddit community. At a time when the volatility of cryptocurrencies is constantly in the news, the poster encourages readers to&nbsp;<q>trust the tech, trust the math</q>, and&nbsp;<q>give bitcoin the time to flourish&hellip; believe me, it will.</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a unique story of one early investstor&rsquo;s Bitcoin journey. The title of the post, &ldquo;My Bitcoin Story&rdquo;, inspired other users on the site to post their stories as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Investing Talents Instead of Cash</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Reddit user u/nopara73&nbsp;shared&nbsp;another Bitcoin story, inspired by u/thecommontheme. While u/thecommontheme&rsquo;s Bitcoin story was one of unrelenting dedication to the new technology, u/nopara73&rsquo;s story is somewhat different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This poster bought into Bitcoin when it was $1000 per coin. After that, the notoriously fickle cryptocurrency had a long downtrend. Unwilling to ride the waves, the poster pulled their money out of Bitcoin and invested in various altcoins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately for Bitcoin-dedicated readers, the story doesn&rsquo;t end there. The poster returned to Bitcoin, not only as an investor but as a developer. The story ends with the poster reminding readers that investing money into a new technology is important but so is investing one&rsquo;s skills. That way, according to this Redditor,&nbsp;<q>If bitcoin crashes tomorrow, if I zero out tomorrow, I will still have the skills I&rsquo;ve learned.</q></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Bitcoin Saved a Cash-Strapped Traveler</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Our&nbsp;third pick&nbsp;is also one Redditor&rsquo;s story. The poster,&nbsp;u/btc32123, had some Bitcoin but was traveling through South America on debit cards. Debit cards were not widely available in South America at the time, so the poster would use ATMs where available to take out small amounts of money. When an ATM &ldquo;ate&rdquo; the poster&rsquo;s debit card, they had few options but to pay high money transferring fees from banks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While weighing options, the poster found a cafe that accepted Bitcoin and stopped inside for some food. The shop owner offered to purchase the poster&rsquo;s Bitcoin. Naturally, the poster accepted, made a profit on their Bitcoin, and walked away with spending cash without having to pay high bank fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This story may not have a moral about being patient with investments or being open minded when it comes to how to invest, but it is an interesting story about cryptocurrencies across borders.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Buying Bitcoin from a &ldquo;Dealer&rdquo;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images6.alphacoders.com/888/888108.png\" style=\"height:350px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel Blank&nbsp;shared&nbsp;his interesting Bitcoin story on question-and-answer site Quora. Blank&rsquo;s story takes place in 2013. Bitcoin was becoming better known and more popular, but it was also harder to mine than it once had been. It was also harder to buy than it is now. One of the easiest ways to get into Bitcoin was through &ldquo;dealers&rdquo; who sold Bitcoin for cash. So that&rsquo;s just what Blank and his friend did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finding a Bitcoin dealer was easy, but meeting him was harder than Blanks had expected. Blanks wondered what he had gotten himself into as he and his friend went to the location where they would meet their dealer, cash in hand. What they found wasn&rsquo;t what they had expected, however.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><q>The big, bad &lsquo;dealer&rsquo; that we were so nervous to meet was this 13-year-old kid sitting on a bitcoin stockpile that he mined a couple of years earlier when it was easy.</q></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There might be a morale in there about holding onto your Bitcoin to sell when the time is right. Even if there isn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s a fun story that illustrates an interesting time in the history of the cryptocurrency.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Finding Bitcoin While Debunking an Altcoin</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The final Bitcoin story also comes from Quora. Sudhir Khatwani&nbsp;posted&nbsp;his Bitcoin story about hearing a pitch for an early altcoin called Swiscoin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Khatwani decided to do his due diligence by researching Swiscoin, which he believed to be some kind of ponzi scheme. While doing his research, he decided to look into Bitcoin as well and learn more about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Khawtwani still had his suspicions about Swiscoin, Bitcoin intrigued him. After further research, he got involved in Bitcoin, first as an investor and then as a writer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the name looked familiar to you, you may have come across it in the past. Khatwani has been writing for the cryptocurrency news site CoinSutra for some time now, and until recently served as their editor-in-chief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The morale of this Bitcoin story is clearly about doing your research before you start investing in cryptocurrency. However, it&rsquo;s also about not being scared of cryptocurrency because you found one dodgy case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We may understand cryptocurrencies a little better now than some of these posters. However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we&rsquo;ve heard or told the last Bitcoin story.</p>', 0, 'jpeg_1566227085.jpg', '2019-08-18 15:15:42', '2019-08-19 11:04:45'),
(22, 'Light Bulb', 'Thomas Edison and his Light Bulb', 'light-bulb', '<p>Thomas Alva Edison, born in Ohio on February 11, 1847, was one of the most well-known inventors of all time. He spent a few of his early years in formal schooling, but he received most of his education at home. Thomas set up a laboratory in the basement of his family&#39;s Michigan home and spent most of his time experimenting. Edison&#39;s mother, Nancy, knew her son was fond of chemistry and electronics, so she gave him books to read on the subjects. One book explained how to perform chemistry experiments at home; Thomas did every one in the book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A biographer of Edison once noted: &quot;His mother had accomplished that which all truly great teachers do for their pupils, she brought him to the stage of learning things for himself, learning that which most amused and interested him, and she encouraged him to go on in that path. It was the very best thing she could have done for this singular boy.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Edison himself put it:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><em><span style=\"background-color:#ffdab9\">&quot;My mother was the making of me. She understood me; she let me follow my bent.&quot;</span></em></span></span></span></h2>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1859, the Grand Trunk Railroad was extended to Port Huron, Michigan. Thomas got a job as a newsboy for the day-long trip to Detroit and back. Since there was a five-hour layover in Detroit, Edison asked for permission to move his laboratory to the baggage car of the train so he could continue his experiments there. This worked for a little while, until the train lurched forward and spilled some chemicals, setting the laboratory on fire. While working for the railroad, Thomas saved the life of a station official&#39;s child who had fallen onto the tracks of an oncoming train. As a way of thanking him for saving his child&#39;s life, the father taught Thomas how to use the telegraph.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas became so good at using the telegraph that he got a job working as a telegrapher sending signals between the United States and Canada. He began experimenting with ways to improve the telegraph, which led to his invention of the automatic telegraph, duplex telegraph, and message printer. It was about this time that Thomas dedicated his life to being a full-time inventor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas Edison moved to New York and set up a small laboratory in Newark, New Jersey. He continued his work on the telegraph and his ideas also gave birth to the universal stock ticker. In 1875, Edison wanted to build a new laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. His father Samuel supervised the construction of the new laboratory; it opened in 1876.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"ÐÐ¾ÑÐ¾Ð¶ÐµÐµ Ð¸Ð·Ð¾Ð±ÑÐ°Ð¶ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ðµ\" src=\"https://printawallpaper.com/upload/designs/old_hanging_bulb_detail.jpg\" style=\"height:467px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the period from 1878 to 1880 Edison and his associates worked on at least three thousand different theories to develop an efficient incandescent lamp. Incandescent lamps make light by using electricity to heat a thin strip of material (called a filament) until it gets hot enough to glow. Many inventors had tried to perfect incandescent lamps to &quot;sub-divide&quot; electric light or make it smaller and weaker than it was in the existing arc lamps, which were too bright to be used for small spaces such as the rooms of a house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Edison&#39;s lamp would consist of a filament housed in a glass vacuum bulb. He had his own glass blowing shed where the fragile bulbs were carefully crafted for his experiments. Edison was trying to come up with a high resistance system that would require far less electrical power than was used for the arc lamps. This could eventually mean small electric lights suitable for home use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By January 1879, at his laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey, Edison had built his first high resistance, incandescent electric light. It worked by passing electricity through a thin platinum filament in the glass vacuum bulb, which delayed the filament from melting. Still, the lamp only burned for a few short hours. In order to improve the bulb, Edison needed all the persistence he had learned years before in his basement laboratory. He tested thousands and thousands of other materials to use for the filament. He even thought about using tungsten, which is the metal used for light bulb filaments now, but he couldn&#39;t work with it given the tools available at that time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One day, Edison was sitting in his laboratory absent-mindedly rolling a piece of compressed carbon between his fingers. He began carbonizing materials to be used for the filament. He tested the carbonized filaments of every plant imaginable, including baywood, boxwood, hickory, cedar, flax, and bamboo. He even contacted biologists who sent him plant fibers from places in the tropics. Edison acknowledged that the work was tedious and very demanding, especially on his workers helping with the experiments. He always recognized the importance of hard work and determination.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffdab9\">&quot;Before I got through,&quot; he recalled, &quot;I tested no fewer than 6,000 vegetable growths, and ransacked the world for the most suitable filament material.&quot;</span></span></span></span></h2>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffdab9\">&quot;The electric light has caused me the greatest amount of study and has required the most elaborate experiments,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I was never myself discouraged, or inclined to be hopeless of success. I cannot say the same for all my associates.&quot;</span></span></span></span></h2>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h2><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffdab9\">&quot;Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.&quot;</span></span></span></span></h2>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Edison decided to try a carbonized cotton thread filament. When voltage was applied to the completed bulb, it began to radiate a soft orange glow. Just about fifteen hours later, the filament finally burned out. Further experimentation produced filaments that could burn longer and longer with each test. Patent number 223,898 was given to Edison&#39;s electric lamp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Edison lamp from our Attic is dated January 27, 1880. It is a product of the continued improvements Edison made to the 1879 bulb. Even though it is over a hundred years old, this bulb looks very much like the light bulbs lighting your house right now. The base, or socket, on this 19th century lamp is similar to the ones still used today. It was one of the most important features of Edison&#39;s lamp and electrical system. The label on this bulb reads,&nbsp;<strong>&quot;New Type Edison Lamp. Patented Jan. 27, 1880 OTHER EDISON PATENTS.&quot;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early 1880s, Edison planned and supervised the construction of the first commercial, central electric power station in New York City. In 1884, Edison began construction of a new laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey, where he lived and worked for the rest of his life. The West Orange facility is now part of the Edison National Historic Site, run by the National Park Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before he died in 1931, Edison patented 1,093 of his inventions. The wonders of his mind include the microphone, telephone receiver, universal stock ticker, phonograph, kinetoscope (used to view moving pictures), storage battery, electric pen, and mimeograph. Edison improved many other existing devices as well. From a discovery made by one of his associates, he patented the Edison effect (now called thermionic diode), which is the basis for all electron tubes. Edison will forever be remembered for his contributions to the incandescent light bulb. Even though he didn&#39;t dream up the first light bulb ever crafted, and technology continues to change every day, Edison&#39;s work with light bulbs was a spark of brilliance on the timeline of invention. At the very beginning of his experiments with the incandescent lamp in 1879, he said:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffffcc\">&quot;</span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:#ffdab9\">We are striking it big in the electric light, better than my vivid imagination first conceived. Where this thing is going to stop Lord only knows.&quot;</span></span></span></span></h2>\r\n</blockquote>', 0, 'jpeg_1566243449.jpg', '2019-08-18 15:36:47', '2019-08-19 15:37:29'),

(24, 'Husky', '10 Facts About Huskies', 'husky', '<p>Siberian huskies are known for their wolfish good looks, but deep down, they&#39;re all dog.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Huskies are born to run.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"ÐÐ°ÑÑÐ¸Ð½ÐºÐ¸ Ð¿Ð¾ Ð·Ð°Ð¿ÑÐ¾ÑÑ 10 Facts About Huskies\" src=\"https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_auto,h_1248,w_2220/f_auto,q_auto,w_1100/v1555274406/shape/mentalfloss/istock-146773846.jpg\" style=\"height:449px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the semi-nomadic Chukchi people of Siberia had to expand their hunting grounds some 3000 years ago, they sought to breed the&nbsp;ideal sled dog. These dogs had to have endurance, a high tolerance to cold, and the ability to survive on very little food. The resulting pups could carry loads over long distances&nbsp;without food&nbsp;or warmth. While there is controversy as to how pure the lineage is, Siberian huskies are widely believed to be the closest to the original Chukchi dogs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Their skills impressed Alaskans.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Huskies made their American debut at the second year of the All Alaska Sweepstakes Race in 1909. Rumor had it that these canines were superior sled dogs; they proved the gossip true by dominating the racing competitions in Alaska for the following decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. A lot of features help keep them warm.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Huskies have a thick double coat that keeps them&nbsp;well insulated. Their undercoat is short and warm, while the overcoat is long and water-resistant. Their almond-shaped eyes allow them to squint to keep out snow. Huskies will wrap their tails around their faces while they sleep; their breath warms the tail and keeps the nose and face protected from the cold.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. A group saved a small town in Alaska.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1925, the children of Nome came down with the widely feared disease called diphtheria. The closest anti-toxin was&nbsp;1000 miles away&nbsp;in a hospital in Anchorage. The train could only take the medicine so far, and it was up to mushers with teams of sled dogs to transport the package the remaining 674 miles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twenty mushers and their sled dogs battled the bitter cold in a relay to get the medicine there safely. It took 127.5 hours to complete the mission, but the medicine made it to the village. The final leg was completed by a black Siberian husky and his team. When finally reaching their destination, the dogs were hailed as heroes and appeared in newspapers across the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If this story sounds familiar, you might remember it&nbsp;from the animated movie,&nbsp;<em>Balto</em>. You can&nbsp;see a statue&nbsp;of&nbsp;Balto in New York&#39;s Central Park (the real Balto is stuffed and mounted at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5.

This&nbsp;can be charming, but it&#39;s not very helpful when you&rsquo;re looking for a canine sentry. Of course, their fierce wolf-like features might be enough to deter any intruders.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6. Huskies don&rsquo;t get fatigued.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Huskies often run long distances on very little food. When humans attempt this, we start to use our body&rsquo;s glycogen and fat and eventually get fatigued. But huskies burn a lot of calories without ever tapping into these other energy stores&mdash;and they do this by regulating their metabolism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Before the race, the dogs&rsquo; metabolic makeup is similar to humans. Then suddenly they throw a switch&mdash;we don&rsquo;t know what it is yet&mdash;that reverses all of that,&rdquo; animal exercise researcher Dr. Michael S. Davis&nbsp;told the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>. &ldquo;In a 24-hour period, they go back to the same type of metabolic baseline you see in resting subjects. But it&rsquo;s while they are running 100 miles a day.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>7. You need to watch them closely.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>These pups love to run and explore. They&#39;re known to be&nbsp;escape artistsand are capable of digging under fences and slipping out of leashes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>8. The army used them.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>During WWII, the army employed the pups as&nbsp;search and rescue dogs. They were also&nbsp;used for&nbsp;transportation, freighting, and communication.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>9. They&rsquo;re closely related to wolves.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies say&nbsp;that the shiba inu and the chow chow share the most DNA with the grey wolf. Coming in near the top is the Siberian husky. That said, huskies are domesticated dogs and have evolved separately from their wild cousins for thousands of years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>10. Blue eyes make them distinct.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"ÐÐ°ÑÑÐ¸Ð½ÐºÐ¸ Ð¿Ð¾ Ð·Ð°Ð¿ÑÐ¾ÑÑ husky eyes\" src=\"https://compote.slate.com/images/5f26fa71-8bd0-4492-9162-33cf1ea02a83.jpeg?width=780&amp;height=520&amp;rect=1560x1040&amp;offset=0x0\" style=\"height:533px; width:800px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not many dog breeds can boast piercing blue eyes. Some dogs&mdash;like the&nbsp;Australian shepherd or Weimaraner&mdash;have them thanks to&nbsp;the merle gene, which results in the loss of pigmentation. But huskies can have bright eyes without that gene.</p>', 0, 'jpeg_1566228503.jpg', '2019-08-18 17:43:07', '2019-08-19 11:28:23'),
(25, 'Fruit Cakes', 'TOP 3 COMPELLING FRUIT CAKE RECIPES', 'fruit-cakes', '<p>They are so famous and easy to make, no doubt every mother would love to prepare a fruit cake. All you need is just a couple of favorite fruits and a wish to start. These cakes are pretty much useful for every type of celebration and even just for an after meal dessert. Fruit cakes have a lot advantages comparing to other cakes, one is that fruit is healthier and more refreshing. It gives a unique taste, especially mixed with some chocolate or other sweet delight. Top Inspired has packed up ten irresistible fruit cake recipes, you just need to select some of these and share your fav.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>White Chocolate Layer Cake with Apricot Filling and White Chocolate Buttercream</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_CvlpDwgQnhg/THFmXUxe9kI/AAAAAAAAA-o/Or3r2YYGLuM/s1600/IMG_2743.JPG\" style=\"height:450px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1) &nbsp;After my cakes were out of the pans and completely cooled, I flash froze them for about 20 minutes, then took them out of the freezer and sliced them in half. &nbsp;This was an infinitely more pleasant task because they were cold and hard and I did not need to fret about them breaking in half. &nbsp;After they were sliced, I&nbsp;wrapped each of the four halves doubly in plastic, and put them in freezer bags for the next day. &nbsp;This is preparing ahead and good planning. :)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) Absolutely put some waxed paper etc. just underneath the base of your cake to protect your cake board or serving plate from your messy frosting or nuts or whatever crazy things you put on your cake. &nbsp;Think of this like painters tape to give your cake a clean finished edge and protect the areas you don&#39;t want to get dirty. You can see how I did this in the photo below, and I actually just used the remnants left over from when I cut out the parchment rounds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3) Crumb coat, crumb coat, crumb coat. &nbsp;If you don&#39;t know what I am talking about, the crumb coat is a very thin layer of frosting that catches all the crumbs so they don&#39;t get caught up in the final frosting and make your cake look less beautiful; also, it helps to put a first layer of color on the cake, to prep for the final color. &nbsp;Again in terms of painting, think of it like priming a wall. &nbsp;Make sure to let the crumb coat set in the fridge or freezer as the recipe suggests. &nbsp;This gives you a perfect clean slate to apply to thicker coat of frosting.&nbsp; And now for small recipe changes and tips from The Cilantropist:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Definitely follow the recipe when it lists times for letting the cake set in the fridge but also for time spent out of the fridge. &nbsp;The buttercream will not be soft enough if you don&#39;t let the cake sit at room temp before serving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-An angled icing spatula like the one below is SUPER helpful for putting on smooth frosting, but not essential. &nbsp;Mine is from&nbsp;Wilton<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/9UGYijdviPbMK_5GFHgKeG0_f6fP3WFwcfL73h2ejgJlu6t0UhColReeCmcML_YjA7ssEiVhUx7vmlbrr_NBvEt7b_a1Yv1OkJdU6uBX_wCZbAMuSNlES69TzyXYp37T77L2IL9U2bp-IXn8H0yCIDci7-U=s0-d\" style=\"height:1px; width:1px\" />, and you can pick it up for just a few bucks. &nbsp;In a pinch, I have used a regular angled spatula (like you would use for flipping eggs or pancakes) and it has done the job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-For the cake, I used only 7 ounces of white chocolate and it tasted great. &nbsp;Go with what you can easily buy (some bars are 3.5oz, others are 4oz).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Rather than 1 1/4 pound of white chocolate in the buttercream, I used just barely over 1 pound. &nbsp;White chocolate is expensive and sweet, and I didn&#39;t want to go overboard with either. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-I am not a huge fan of walnuts, so I put slivered almonds on the sides of the cake instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-For the apricot filling, I used 4 apricots diced and 1 1/2 cup of peach jam (divide apricots and jam evenly between 3 layers).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Instead of plain sugar syrup to moisten the cake, I had some reserved peach syrup from&nbsp;making jam&nbsp;and so I used that. &nbsp;Use what you have on hand, and don&#39;t worry about making the peach syrup unless you want to make the jam as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-I put sliced peaches on the top of the cake.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enjoy, and as always, email with any questions or post in comments below!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Fruit Pizza Beach Ball</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Make a sweet and refreshing Fruit Pizza Beach Ball for your summer party.

This cake was very popular among local bloggers sometime back. I told her I would probably give it a try when she first made this cake. Almost two years down the road, and I totally forgot about it until I saw her&nbsp;photo&nbsp;of this same cake recently. With fruits piling over a thick layer of beautiful golden crumbs that comes with a nicely browned crust, how can anyone not fall in love with it?! Since I would be meeting VB&#39;s friend to collect a cookbook from her, I thought it would be an excellent idea to make this cake for her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br />\r\n100g butter, soften at room temperature&nbsp;<br />\r\n200g caster sugar (I cut down to180g)<br />\r\n50g sour cream (I replaced with same amount of&nbsp;low fat yogurt)<br />\r\n3 eggs, lightly beaten, room temperature<br />\r\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract&nbsp;<br />\r\n1 teaspoon lemon or orange zest<br />\r\n210g plain flour&nbsp;<br />\r\n1 teaspoon baking powder<br />\r\n500g fruits* tossed with 2 tablespoon sugar*<br />\r\n(You can use strawberries, blueberries, peaches, bananas, oranges, pears, apples, pineapple, or any other fruits that are not too juicy. I omitted the sugar and used as much fruits, either fresh or canned, as needed to fill the top of the cake)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Wash, cut (chunks or slices, as desired) and drain fruits, toss with sugar (if desired) and set aside. (if using canned fruits, wash the fruits to remove the syrup, omit the sugar).</li>\r\n	<li>Grease (with butter) and flour the side of a 9&quot; round pan or a 8&quot; square pan and line the base with parchment paper.</li>\r\n	<li>With an electric mixer, cream butter, sugar and sour cream (or yogurt) till light and fluffy.</li>\r\n	<li>Dribble in the eggs gradually and beat till incorporated in the batter. (The mixture may appear slightly curdled.)</li>\r\n	<li>Add vanilla extract and zest. Mix to combine.</li>\r\n	<li>Sieve over flour and baking powder and mix till smooth. (To avoid getting flour all over my work surface, I mixed the flour into the batter using a spatula, just a few strokes will do, then I used the electric mixer to mix the batter till smooth.)</li>\r\n	<li>Pour batter into prepared pan and smooth out the top with a spatula.</li>\r\n	<li>Arrange fruits on top, don&rsquo;t press the fruits down into the batter. Decorate the fruits as desired.</li>\r\n	<li>Bake in pre-heat oven at 180degC for 60-70 minutes or until a skewer comes out clean when inserted into the cake. Cover the top with foil in the last 15 mins of baking to prevent the top from getting over browned.</li>\r\n	<li>Leave the cake to cool in the pan for about 5~10 mins. Unmold and transfer to wire rack to let cool completely. Dust the cake with some icing sugar if desired.</li>\r\n</ol>', 0, 'jpeg_1566243554.jpg', '2019-08-19 09:27:56', '2019-08-19 15:39:14');

(26, 'Airpods', 'Best AirPods alternatives', 'airpods', '<p>AirPods&nbsp;are great&nbsp;if you have an&nbsp;iPhone&nbsp;and prioritize ease of use over sound quality. As the true wireless market has developed, though, there are more viable AirPods alternatives than ever. This means you don&rsquo;t need to buy into the Apple ecosystem to have a streamlined listening experience. If you&rsquo;re intrigued by Apple&rsquo;s true wireless solution but want better sound quality, we&rsquo;ve compiled a list of the best AirPods alternatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The best AirPods alternatives are the Samsung Galaxy Buds</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy Buds are the ideal complement to the&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy S10&nbsp;suite of smartphones. Although the earbuds don&rsquo;t support aptX, they do provide AAC and the scalable Samsung codec. The latter works flawlessly with the Samsung S10e, intelligently balancing bitrate and&nbsp;connectivity. Additionally, if you have a Galaxy S10 device, you can wirelessly charge the earbuds by placing them atop the phone; nifty.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Samsung Galaxy Buds</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S10-Plus-and-Samsung-Galaxy-Buds-5-of-X-840x473.jpg\" style=\"height:394px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the earbuds operate via Bluetooth 5.0 and maintain a reliable connection within the 10-meter range. If you do happen to stray from your phone, the earbuds support&nbsp;Google Assistant; so you can tell it to skip tracks or create an event. With the dual-microphone array, your respective assistant will always hear your commands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the Galaxy Buds are only IPX2-certified, they withstood my runs and gym visits without issue. By far the best feature of the Buds is the insane battery life: these allow for 6.53 hours of constant playback on a single charge. Plus, when the battery does deplete, just 15 minutes in the case provides an additional 1.7 hours of listening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Audio quality is excellent if you&rsquo;re using the Galaxy Buds with a compatible Samsung device. Unfortunately, AAC on Android leaves a lot to be desired, but the AKG-tuned drivers deliver a clear, neutral-leaning sound that bodes well for a variety of genres.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>What you should know about AirPods alternatives</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to get the abridged version of everything you need to know about the best Apple earbuds alternatives, then read through our quick sections below. For those who have more time and want to learn more, be sure to click through our more comprehensive features linked throughout the following sections!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Wireless headphones don&rsquo;t compare to wired when it comes to audio quality</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/aac-lossless-sbc-fr.jpg\"><img alt=\"best AirPods alternatives - A chart showing the frequency response performance of the AAC Bluetooth wireless codec.\" src=\"https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/aac-lossless-sbc-fr-1024x672.jpg\" style=\"height:459px; width:700px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s true. If you want the&nbsp;best audio quality, you need to kick it old school and connect via a&nbsp;TRRS plug. We have a handful of Bluetooth codec-related articles for you to take in on your own time, but for now, know this: If you&rsquo;re an iPhone user looking for AirPods alternatives, you&rsquo;ll want to look at &lsquo;buds that support&nbsp;AAC. If, on the other hand, you&rsquo;re an Android user who&rsquo;s drawn to the AirPods but don&rsquo;t actually want them, go for picks with&nbsp;aptX&nbsp;support. Android can&rsquo;t yet efficiently encode the AAC codec, meaning its performance varies drastically depending on what Android smartphone you&rsquo;re using.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>True wireless connectivity is unreliable across the board</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Apple-new-AirPods-2_earbuds-case-separate.jpg\"><img alt=\"best AirPods alternatives - Apple new AirPods 2 on an arts magazine with the case above it, shut.\" src=\"https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Apple-new-AirPods-2_earbuds-case-separate-1024x575.jpg\" style=\"height:393px; width:700px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everything has its pros and cons and true wireless earbuds are no different. What we gain with convenience and freedom of movement, we sacrifice with regards to reliability. Even though companies are making strides, namely Apple with its&nbsp;H1 chip, when it comes to stable connectivity, there remains a&nbsp;long way to go. If you need a guaranteed stable, wireless connection,&nbsp;standard wireless earbuds&nbsp;are likely a better choice. Either that or the&nbsp;new AirPods&nbsp;for iPhone users.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A proper fit can make or break sound quality</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V4QTHIOM7Gg\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most common gripes about the AirPods is their complete lack of seal. Not only does this make them fairly uncomfortable for many to wear, but it also has a significant, negative impact on audio quality. Since the AirPods are unable to&nbsp;isolate&nbsp;you from your surroundings, environmental noise can permeate through the earbuds and severely&nbsp;mask your audio. The first thing to go? Bass response. This is why the AirPods have such a strong bass response: it&rsquo;s compensatory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While all of our best AirPods alternatives picks have distinguished nozzles that truly insert into the ear, sometimes the included ear tips just don&rsquo;t jive well. If that&rsquo;s the case, there are plenty of third-party ear tips you can choose from. Memory foam options tend to yield the best results by improving bass response and clarity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Ignore chatty neighbors with the Sony WF-SP700N</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Sony&rsquo;s been flexing their noise cancelling technology demonstrated by the&nbsp;WH-1000XM3&nbsp;over-ear headphones. The company&rsquo;s true wireless noise cancelling option is a nice, more portable option to have though.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sony WF-SP700N</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Sony_WF-700N-1.jpg\" style=\"height:467px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These earbuds are also water-resistant, although less so than the TrueConnect, and have been awarded an official IPX4 certification. The fit is stable and comfortable, making the &lsquo;buds a great option for athletes and commuters alike. If you do happen to commute with them, the noise cancellation will effectively combat low rumbles but can&rsquo;t counteract abrupt, sharp noises very well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arguably one of the most frustrating things of these true wireless earbuds is the amount of concentration required to place them in the case. It&rsquo;s surprisingly easy to think that you&rsquo;ve done a fine job and that the earbuds are charging only to realize a few hours later the &lsquo;buds were off by a millimeter and never actually charged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the WF-SP700N doesn&rsquo;t support aptX, AAC is supported which is good for&nbsp;iPhone&nbsp;users looking into AirPods alternatives. On the whole, these are an excellent pair of true wireless earbuds and the best when it comes to active noise cancelling technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Beats Powerbeats Pro has the best battery life</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want a pair of true wireless that will last you the longest, go with the&nbsp;Beats Powerbeats Pro&nbsp;which in hour testing passed 10 hours of constant playback on both Android and iOS. That&rsquo;s enough for a cross-country flight from New York to California including the ride to the airport. That said, you still might not want to use these on the airplane as the isolation isn&rsquo;t that great so the engine sound of the airplane will have no trouble finding its way to your ears. For that, we suggest you check out a pair of&nbsp;noise-cancelling headphones. Instead, the Powerbeats Pro are the headphones to bring with you on a run or to the gym. The hook design means these will have a hard time falling out and they come with an&nbsp;IPX4&nbsp;certification making them sweat and water resistant which is more than can be said for the AirPods.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Beats Powerbeats Pro</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Beats-Powerbeats-Pro-4.jpg\" style=\"height:394px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s all the extra stuff that you&rsquo;d expect from a pair of AirPods that you also get here thanks to the built-in H1 chip. Pairing is a breeze on iOS and isn&rsquo;t half bad on Android either, plus the connection strength is top notch so you won&rsquo;t experience too many annoying drops or stutters in your music playback. Surprisingly, the Powerbeats Pro also doesn&rsquo;t sound half bad, at least when compared to other&nbsp;Beats headphones. While they still have that&nbsp;consumer-friendly bump&nbsp;to the lows, they&rsquo;re not overpowering at all. Microphone quality is also pretty great and Apple included a nifty feature that uses the accelerometers in the headphones to know when your jaw is moving and when you&rsquo;re talking. When it detects that you&rsquo;re not talking it will shut off the microphone when you&rsquo;re on a call, helping to avoid any unwanted background noise mid-conversation. Pretty sweet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Indulge in the handsome Master &amp; Dynamic MW07</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Master &amp; Dynamic, a Brooklyn-based premium audio company, also tried its hand at true wireless with the MW07. Everything from the stainless steel charging case to the acetate housings scream extravagance. Heck, even the 10mm&nbsp;beryllium drivers&nbsp;are sleek even if invisible from the outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Master &amp; Dynamic MW07</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Master-Dynamic-MW07-2.jpg\" style=\"height:394px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>t&rsquo;s not only about form, however; the MW07 can stand a bit of water as proven by its IPX4 rating. What&rsquo;s more the functionality of the playback controls makes blind commands easy and convenient. If we had to nitpick one thing, it would be the battery life, which is average for true wireless earbuds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, if you want your truly wireless earbuds to be recognized as a piece of modern art, the MW07 is the opulent choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>The JLab JBuds Air Executive is the best value</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;JLab JBuds Air Executive&nbsp;offers AAC support, which is great news for iPhone users. The earbuds provide a stable fit and the whole package can be had for less than $70. The stemmed design is similar to the AirPods and others like the&nbsp;Mobvoi TicPods Free&nbsp;and&nbsp;RHA TrueConnect. While these aren&rsquo;t specifically designed for&nbsp;working out, the IP55 rating gives them a versatile edge. They also stay in place well thanks to the proprietary cush fins which wrap around the housings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>JLab JBuds Air Executive</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/JLab_JBuds-Air-Executive-5_earbud-touch-control-case.jpg\" style=\"height:393px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The controls are comprehensive and easy to operate via a touch panel on either earbud.

(27, 'Jellyfish', '11 astonishing facts about jellyfish', 'jellyfish', '<p>They&#39;re gooey, they sting and they&#39;re probably not the first thing that comes to mind when you think of seafood, but jellyfish are surprisingly fascinating creatures. They can mesmerize aquarium crowds like few other organisms, and they&#39;re some of Earth&#39;s most ancient animals that are still alive today. Take a few moments to revel in these fun facts about jellyfish. You might be surprised at what you don&#39;t know about these oddly charismatic gelatinous creatures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>They predate the dinosaurs by hundreds of millions of years.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Jellyfish\" src=\"https://media.mnn.com/assets/images/2014/12/pinkjellyfish.jpg.653x0_q80_crop-smart.jpg\" style=\"height:467px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jellyfish have no bones, so fossils are hard to come by. Nevertheless, scientists have evidence these creatures have been bobbing along in the world&#39;s oceans for&nbsp;at least 500 million years. In fact, it&#39;s likely the jellyfish lineage goes back even further, possibly&nbsp;700 million years or longer. That&#39;s roughly three times the age of the first dinosaurs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>They aren&#39;t actually fish; they&#39;re gelatinous zooplankton.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"jellyfish swimming with fish\" src=\"https://media.mnn.com/assets/images/2015/01/jellyfish-and-fish.jpg\" style=\"height:396px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One look at a jellyfish and this might seem rather obvious, but they aren&#39;t actually fish. They are invertebrates from the phylum Cnidaria, and are so varied as a taxonomic group that many scientists have taken to simply referring to them as &quot;gelatinous zooplankton.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>They are 98 percent water, without a brain or a heart.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Jellyfish seem to blend in to their environment, undulating gently with the ocean&#39;s currents, and with good reason: Their bodies are made up of as much as&nbsp;98 percent water! When they wash ashore, they can disappear after just a few hours as their bodies evaporate into the air. They have a rudimentary nervous system, a loose network of nerves located in the epidermis called a &quot;nerve net,&quot; but no brain. They also don&#39;t have a heart; their gelatinous bodies are so thin that they can be oxygenated solely by diffusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>But some have eyes ...</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"box jellyfish with eyes\" src=\"https://media.mnn.com/assets/images/2015/01/box-jellyfish-with-eyes.jpg\" style=\"height:396px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite their simplistic body design, some jellyfish do still have the ability to see. In fact, for a few species their&nbsp;vision can be surprisingly complex. For instance, the box jellyfish has 24 &quot;eyes,&quot; two of which are actually capable of seeing in color. It is also believed this animal&#39;s complicated array of visual sensors make it one of the few creatures in the world to have a full 360-degree view of its environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Some might be immortal.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>At least one unique species of jellyfish, Turritopsis nutricula,&nbsp;may never actually die. When threatened, this species is capable of undergoing &quot;cellular transdifferentiation,&quot; a process whereby the organism&#39;s cells can essentially become new again. In other words, this jellyfish has a built-in fountain of youth. It is theoretically immortal!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>They poop where they eat.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It might not sound very appetizing, but jellyfish have no need for separate orifices for eating and pooping. They have one orifice that does the job of&nbsp;both the mouth and the anus. Yuck! But that&#39;s also beautiful in a minimalist sort of way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A group of jellyfish is called ...</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A group of dolphins is called a pod, a group of fish is called a school and a group of crows is called a murder. But what is&nbsp;a group of jellyfish&nbsp;called? Many refer to groups of jellyfish as blooms or swarms, but they can also be called a &quot;smack.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>They are among Earth&#39;s deadliest creatures.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9z8ujpPgUjI\" width=\"700\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All jellyfish have nematocysts, or stinging structures, but the power of their stings can vary widely depending on the species. The&nbsp;most venomous jellies in the world&nbsp;are probably the box jellyfish, capable of killing an adult human with a single sting in just a few minutes. Each box jellyfish reportedly carries enough venom to kill more than 60 humans. To make matters worse, their stings are excruciatingly painful &mdash; it&#39;s said the pain alone could kill you before the venom does. On the bright side, researchers are developing a&nbsp;potential antidote&nbsp;for box jellyfish stings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>They range widely in size.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"lions mane jellyfish\" src=\"https://media.mnn.com/assets/images/2015/01/lions-mane-jellyfish.jpg\" style=\"height:396px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some jellyfish are so tiny they are practically invisible floating in the ocean&#39;s currents &mdash; the smallest are those in the genera Staurocladia and Eleutheria, which have bell disks from just 0.5 millimeters to a few millimeters in diameter. By contrast, the world&#39;s largest jellyfish are true monsters. The lion&#39;s mane jellyfish, Cyanea capillata, might be the world&#39;s longest, with tentacles that can&nbsp;extend as far as 120 feet! But the perhaps the world&#39;s largest jellyfish by weight and diameter is the titanic&nbsp;Nomura&#39;s jellyfish, Nemopilema nomurai, which can completely dwarf a human diver. These beasts can have a bell diameter of six and a half feet across and weigh as much as 440 pounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Some are edible.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You won&#39;t find them on many restaurant menus, but jellyfish are edible and are eaten as a delicacy in some places, such as in Japan and Korea. In fact, in Japan jellyfish have been transformed into candy. A sweet and salty caramel made out of sugar, starch syrup and jellyfish powder has been produced by students in an effort to make use of the jellyfish smacks that often plague the waters there.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>They have been to space.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Though they look rather alien, jellyfish are indeed from planet Earth. Nevertheless, they have been to space. NASA first started sending jellyfish to space aboard the Columbia space shuttle back in the early &#39;90s to test how they might get along in a zero-gravity environment. Why? Interestingly, both humans and jellyfish rely on specialized gravity-sensitive calcium crystals in order to orient themselves (these are located inside the inner ear in the case of humans, and along the bottom edge of the mushroom-like bodies of jellies). So studying how jellyfish manage in space can reveal clues about how humans might also fare.</p>', 0, 'jpeg_1566243642.jpg', '2019-08-19 14:27:04', '2019-08-19 15:40:43'),

While most sports require team participation, they all differ in pace and activity level. In order to help our young female youth of America decide what sports are right for them, it is best to learn which sports they are most interested in and what equipment is necessary for them to participate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>#1 Soccer</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Girls Soccer\" src=\"https://girlsandsports.com/images/girls-soccer.jpg\" style=\"height:449px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several female athletes enjoy playing soccer, one of the world&rsquo;s most popular sports. Soccer is great for those who would like to build up lower body strength and are interested in working in a team. In the game of soccer one will need cleats, shin guards, and a soccer ball.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>#2 Volleyball</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Girls Volleyball\" src=\"https://girlsandsports.com/images/girls-volleyball.jpg\" style=\"height:613px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team sport of Volleyball involves 6 players on each team with a net between the two opposing sides. The object of the game is to land the ball on the opposing team&rsquo;s side of the net. Volleyball typically played in an indoor setting but can be placed in a variety of outdoor settings including the beach. All you need to play volleyball are knee pads and a ball.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>#3 Tennis</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Alize Lim - French Tennis Player\" src=\"https://girlsandsports.com/images/alize-lim-french-tennis-player.jpg\" style=\"height:466px; width:700px\" title=\"Alize Lim - French Tennis Player\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tennis is a great sport for those more interested in playing by themselves or with one partner in place of a whole entire team. This relatively fast paced game actually involves less running than most traditional sports. Plus, tennis only requires a small amount of equipment - merely a&nbsp;tennis ball and racquet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>#4 Basketball</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Girls Basketball\" src=\"https://girlsandsports.com/images/girls-basketball.jpg\" style=\"height:504px; width:700px\" title=\"Girls Basketball\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basketball is ideal for those who enjoy a fast-paced game that involves a running, coordination, and upper body strength. As a team sport, Basketball actually needs very little special equipment. The only necessary gear to play basketball are&nbsp;<a href=\"http://girlsandsports.com/bestgirlsrunningshoes.html\">athletic shoes</a>, a hoop, and a ball.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>#5 Softball</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Girls Softball\" src=\"https://girlsandsports.com/images/girls-softball.jpg\" style=\"height:394px; width:700px\" title=\"Girls Softball\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Softball is the perfect sport for team players who do not want to be in constant motion. As a less strenuous sport, Softball still requires hand-eye coordination as well as a combined strength from the upper and lower body. Softball only requires basic equipment including a glove, bat, and softball.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>#6 Lacrosse</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Girls Lacrosse\" src=\"https://girlsandsports.com/images/girls-lacrosse.jpg\" style=\"height:467px; width:700px\" title=\"Girls Lacrosse\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lacrosse is a traditional team sport that requires a good amount of equipment. In addition to the basic lacrosse stick and ball, players will need specific helmets along with specialized eye protection. Not only does the team sport of Lacrosse require a lot running, it also involves a heavy amount of hand-eye coordination in order to get the small ball from the middle of the field past the goalkeepers net.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>#7 Swimming</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Girls Swimming\" src=\"https://girlsandsports.com/images/girls-swimming.jpg\" style=\"height:465px; width:700px\" title=\"Girls Swimming\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As one of the most versatile sports, swimming can be performed individually or as a team. The most popular form of competitive swimming involves racing while maintaining a certain stroke. All that is need to swim competitively is a uniform swimsuit, goggles, and swim cap (which increases speed).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>#8 Golf</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Girls Golf\" src=\"https://girlsandsports.com/images/girls-golf.jpg\" style=\"height:526px; width:700px\" title=\"Girls Golf\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are searching for a more relaxing and less strenuous sport, than golf is the game for you. Other than swinging your club, the most exercise involved in golf is walking from hole to hole and even so, most golfers use motorized carts to get around. Your most vital piece of&nbsp;equipment in golf&nbsp;is your club set.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>#9 Cross Country</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Girls Cross Country\" src=\"https://girlsandsports.com/images/girls-cross-country.jpg\" style=\"height:467px; width:700px\" title=\"Girls Cross Country\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cross country is yet another sport that allows players the option of competing individually or as a team. In short, cross country is a sport that consists of running in or outdoors over a variety of terrains. Plus, the only equipment necessary to join cross country is a great pair of running shoes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>#10 Field Hockey</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Girls Field Hockey\" src=\"https://girlsandsports.com/images/girls-field-hockey.jpg\" style=\"height:469px; width:700px\" title=\"Girls Field Hockey\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Field Hockey is eerily similar to ice hockey, except for the fact that it utilizes a ball on a grass field instead of a puck in an ice rink. The only object of Field hockey is to maneuver the ball into the goal with your hockey stick. You will need to be able to work well with a team through open communication and impeccable hand-eye coordination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Girls all over world enjoy playing sports. Organized sports are a great way for&nbsp;young female athletes&nbsp;to develop important life skills like how to work in a team, discipline, sportsmanship, as well as time and emotional management.

Its success has made champagne a brand of its own, but it&rsquo;s important to remember that it is, first and foremost, a type of wine. A wine from the sparkling family of wines, as opposed to the still varieties.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Champagne region is recognised by UNESCO</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"A few champagne corks, to celebrate its UNESCO status\" src=\"https://images.france.fr/zeaejvyq9bhj/4UpYG7OjTqIeqgYMO46kgW/263ef222b57885daa1b1a376153d9425/champagne_2.jpg?w=680&amp;h=298&amp;q=70&amp;fm=webp&amp;fit=fill\" style=\"height:307px; width:700px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 4 July 4th 2015, the &ldquo;Hillsides, Houses, and Cellars of Champagne&rdquo; were added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

The northernmost is Montagne de Reims, where pinot noir grapes produce robust, generous wines, while the pinot meunier grown in the Marne Valley brings its full fruity flavour to ros&eacute; champagnes. South of &Eacute;pernay, the C&ocirc;te des Blancs and its chalky soil is the promised land for elegant chardonnay, and further south still, the C&ocirc;te des Bar and its continental climate produces a lighter pinot noir.<br />\r\nBut within these larger areas lies a mosaic of smaller terroir, with each parcel of land producing a wine with its own personality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Blanc de blanc or blanc de noir? It&rsquo;s a question of colour</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Blanc de blancs champagne is made using chardonnay, a white grape. That&rsquo;s easy to grasp!<br />\r\nA blanc de noirschampagne is made using only black grapes (Pinot Noir and/or Pinot Meunier). Two grape varieties with darker skin and white flesh.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>It&rsquo;s the only French wine that can be made by mixing red wine and white wine</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two ways to make ros&eacute; champagne. A short maceration of black grapes, extracting some of their colour, or by mixing still white and red wine from the appellation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Champagne method is an interplanetary benchmark</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Champagne (or traditional) method is the meticulously defined winemaking process used to make champagne. Over the centuries, Champagne&rsquo;s winemakers learned how to tame the bubbles to make their diverse range of excellent cuv&eacute;es.

Imagine this is a square 300 by 300 foot block surrounded by a 15 foot street;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is still an over simplified model, but replace &#39;square foot of street&#39; with water pipes, electrical lines, mail routes, fire/police protection, or transit service, and you can see why most American cities are broke. You can&nbsp;<a href=\"http://andrewalexanderprice.com/downloads/streetwidthtax.xlsx\">download my calculations here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have spread our tax base so thin, and built more infrastructure to support it, that the return we are getting on the infrastructure we invest in exponentially decreases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes I feel that I am the only one who sees it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only are narrow streets human-oriented with a great sense of place,&nbsp;<em>they make sense financially.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://andrewalexanderprice.com/images/blog30-18.jpg\"><img src=\"http://andrewalexanderprice.com/images/blog30-18.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:700px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course you still need wide arterial roads to get you across large distances - which traffic engineers should be allowed to go crazy with, because that is their job - to move vehicles across large distances efficiently;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://andrewalexanderprice.com/images/blog30-19.jpg\"><img src=\"http://andrewalexanderprice.com/images/blog30-19.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:700px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But these wide arterial roads should make up around 15%, definitely no more than 25% of your street network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The remaining 75-85% of your streets should be very narrow. 15 feet is a really good width for a quiet street lined with low rise buildings;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://andrewalexanderprice.com/images/blog30-20.jpg\"><img src=\"http://andrewalexanderprice.com/images/blog30-20.jpg\" style=\"height:465px; width:700px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you start going above 25 feet, things start to feel a little barren;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://andrewalexanderprice.com/images/blog30-21.jpg\"><img src=\"http://andrewalexanderprice.com/images/blog30-21.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:700px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make wide streets feel inviting and humane, we need to spend money decorating it. Trees are popular;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://andrewalexanderprice.com/images/blog30-22.jpg\"><img src=\"http://andrewalexanderprice.com/images/blog30-22.jpg\" style=\"height:467px; width:700px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, if your street is already narrow and cozy, you can save a lot of money on decorating;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://andrewalexanderprice.com/images/blog30-23.jpg\"><img src=\"http://andrewalexanderprice.com/images/blog30-23.jpg\" style=\"height:525px; width:700px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Designing streets around cars is a bad idea. Even if you drive, you spend most of your trip driving across town on the arterial roads (or on the highways and freeways between towns.) It does not make much of a difference if you have to spend 2 minutes at the start and end of your trip navigating narrow streets (and because everything is closer together, chances are that your overall trip will be shorter.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Would you want to live in a crappy place just to shave an extra 4 minutes off a long drive?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://andrewalexanderprice.com/images/blog30-24.jpg\"><img src=\"http://andrewalexanderprice.com/images/blog30-24.jpg\" style=\"height:555px; width:700px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://andrewalexanderprice.com/images/blog30-25.jpg\"><img src=\"http://andrewalexanderprice.com/images/blog30-25.jpg\" style=\"height:466px; width:700px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://andrewalexanderprice.com/images/blog30-26.jpg\"><img src=\"http://andrewalexanderprice.com/images/blog30-26.jpg\" style=\"height:467px; width:700px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The material is from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://andrewalexanderprice.com/blog20140422.php#.XVr3hugzbIU\">http://andrewalexanderprice.com/blog20140422.php#.XVr3hugzbIU</a>&nbsp;page.</p>', 0, 'png_1566243980.png', '2019-08-19 15:22:25', '2019-08-19 15:46:20');
